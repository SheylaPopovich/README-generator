## **Description**
Creating a high quality README is very crucial to a developer's repository. README's provide an introduction to the files contained in the repository. Dependent on this introduction it can prevent a person from viewing or wanting to use your repository. This application will generate a professional README.md that will capture other developers to want to view and possibly use your repo. This tool generates a professional README with little to no effort. The README generator is able to read your environment prompting you for data input to then compose a personalized README.md file.
